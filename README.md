#EverWeb: The Internet is Forever

#Abstract
The internet—a vast and dynamic repository of human knowledge, culture, and creativity—faces a persistent threat of data loss. Websites vanish, content changes, and digital artifacts are lost to time. EverWeb aims to combat this issue by creating a decentralized, immutable archive for the web. Using blockchain technology, EverWeb incentivizes contributors to scrape, validate, and store web pages, ensuring that the knowledge of today remains accessible for future generations.
This document outlines EverWeb's vision, technical framework, and economic model, illustrating how it leverages decentralized technologies to preserve the Internet forever.

#Introduction
The Problem
The transient nature of the internet leads to:
Data Loss: Websites disappear or change, erasing valuable content.
Censorship: Centralized control over content can lead to suppression or alteration of important information.
Lack of Trust: Without immutable records, verifying historical digital content becomes challenging.
The Solution
EverWeb addresses these challenges by:
Decentralized Archiving: Leveraging blockchain to create tamper-proof records of web content.
Incentivized Contributions: Rewarding miners for scraping and validators for ensuring accuracy.
Permanent Storage: Utilizing decentralized storage networks for reliable and accessible data storage.

#Vision and Mission
Vision
To create a decentralized, immutable archive that preserves the world's digital heritage, ensuring the knowledge and culture of today are accessible to the generations of tomorrow.
Mission
EverWeb is dedicated to safeguarding the internet's vast trove of information through blockchain-powered decentralization. By enabling a collaborative ecosystem of miners, validators, and storage providers, we create a permanent, tamper-proof record of the web, empowering individuals, researchers, and communities to access unaltered knowledge forever.

#Technical Framework
Core Components
1. Blockchain
EverWeb’s blockchain is the system's backbone, recording metadata, hashes, and validation results.
Consensus Mechanism: Proof of Validation (PoV).
Validators verify scraped data against live sources, ensuring accuracy and timeliness.
On-Chain Data:
Metadata: URL, timestamp, and content hash.
Validator Votes: Approval records for submissions.
2. Decentralized Storage
Canonicalized content, which involves standardizing and simplifying web page data to ensure uniformity and reduce unnecessary elements, is stored off-chain to optimize scalability and storage costs.
Integration:
IPFS or Arweave for permanent, distributed content storage.
Content Retrieval:
Blockchain metadata links to storage nodes, enabling easy access.
3. Scraping and Validation Clients
Miners:
Scrape content from whitelisted websites.
Submit data and pay validation fees.
Validators:
Cross-verify submissions by re-scraping and canonicalizing content.
Approve valid submissions via blockchain consensus.
The whitelist is a curated list of approved websites that miners can scrape for content. This approach controls the scope of the archive, ensuring that only high-value, public, or historically significant sources are included. It helps maintain focus on quality over quantity, preventing the system from being overwhelmed with low-value or unauthorized data. 
Economic Model
Tokenomics
EverWeb’s native token is used to:
Pay validation and query fees.
Reward miners, validators, and storage providers.
Token Flow
Miners:
Earn tokens for submitting valid web scrapes. The reward per page is subject to a maximum of 1 token. A 10% fee is applied to each reward, split evenly between validators and the reward pool to ensure sustainability.
Fees dynamically replenish the reward pool, with 50% of each fee allocated to validators as compensation and the other 50% returned to the reward pool. This mechanism ensures that the reward pool is prolonged. Once the whitelist exceeds the remaining coins, the rewards will be reduced proportionally to ensure there is always an incentive to mine.   
Validators:
Share validation fees based on their participation and reputation.
Query Users:
Pay a fee per page accessed; this fee goes directly back to the rewards pool.
Incentives and Governance
Incentives
Fee-based Distribution:
10% of each reward is collected as a fee, split evenly between validators and the reward pool to sustain network activity.


#Governance
Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO):
Token holders govern the evolution of EverWeb.
Decisions include adding new whitelist sites, adjusting fees, or allocating treasury funds.

#Roadmap
Phase 1: Concept Development (we are here)
Finalize the project’s vision and mission.
Draft whitepaper and initial technical architecture.
Build a simple whitelist with key sites (e.g., Wikipedia, public domain).
Phase 2: Blockchain Prototype
Develop a basic blockchain using Substrate or Cosmos SDK.
Implement scraping and validation mechanisms.
Deploy a local test network.
Phase 3: Scraping and Validation Clients
Build and test miner and validator clients.
Integrate canonicalization processes for scraped data.
Phase 4: Storage and Query System
Connect blockchain with decentralized storage (IPFS or Arweave).
Develop query tools for users to access archived content.
Phase 5: Public Testnet
Launch a public testnet.
Onboard early miners, validators, and users.
Gather feedback to refine the system.
Phase 6: Mainnet Launch
Deploy the fully functional EverWeb network.
Expand the whitelist and incentivize adoption.

#Use Cases
1. Historical Web Data
Preserve news articles, blogs, and cultural artifacts for research and analysis.
2. AI Training Datasets
Provide high-quality datasets for machine learning models.
3. Proof of Records
Ensure unaltered records of important events, publications, or statements.
4. Cultural Preservation
Archive endangered languages, art, and history from the web.

#Conclusion
EverWeb transforms the transient nature of the internet into a permanent, accessible, and trustworthy archive. By combining blockchain technology, decentralized storage, and a robust incentive model, EverWeb ensures that the internet becomes forever.
